# Data Science Ethics
Ethics, regardless of application are essential to uphold the validity and
application of results. Without ethics, there is no distingishable factor
between moral and/or legal right and wrong. By removing this, an application of
results and assumptions can be misused to allow a person or organization to gain
and abuse power, resources, etc.


## Where do Ethics Evolve?
According to Resnik (2015), "...most people acquire their sense of right and
wrong during childhood, moral development occurs throughout life and human
beings pass through different stages of growth as they mature." This means that
most individuals have developed a socially acceptable and normalized set of
ethics. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume that most individuals
understand the value of socially acceptable and normalized ethics. These ethical
norms "...help to ensure that researchers can be held accountable to the 
public." (Resnik, 2015) By involving ethical norms with research, the assumtions
about ethics made by a populous can also be transposed onto data science and
research.


## The Importance of Ethics
Without ethics within software and data science, specifically artificial
intelligence (AI), results and outcomes can be abused. This is exemplified by the
opening statement from the AI Ethics paper from 2015, "You can't have a society
without cooperation. You can't have cooperation without trust." The DataRobot
paper highlights the crucial foundation of a society, trust. Without trust,
there can be no society and without ethics there can be no trust.

This is why ethics are important, the prupose of ethics are to ensure that the
application or usage of something is done in a way that is agreed to be fair by
any party, regardless of their level of involvement. It is crucial to take the
following into consideration:

> Are you assigning a new task to an AI, and if so, what are the additional 
> benefits of this task and who does it benefit? If it is not a new task, then 
> what process is it replacing, whose task does it replace, and who does 
> it benefit? If you are replacing a human task, is it something for which 
> computers have a comparative advantage? Does the AI free up your staff 
> to take on more fulfilling human tasks? Does your new AI task augment 
> your human staff’s ability to succeed? Does your new AI task improve 
> customer experience? Does your new AI task allow you to offer a better 
> product? Does your new AI task expand your organization’s capabilities?
(AI Ethics, n.d.)

Even if only one of these questions are considered, such as "What process is
being replaced by this task?", many ethical concerns can be raised:

- Will workers who were previously responsible for these tasks be able to
support themselves or their familes now that they no longer are responsible
for the task?
- Should this process be automated?
- Who benefits from this automation?
- Would all of society benefit from this automation or would it only be a single
person/organization?
- Will automation present new environmental risks?
- What is the cost to society by automating this process?

This is clearly not a simple or straightfoward problem, there are many nuances
and struggle points for individuals, ogranizations, and society as a whole. This
is why ethics must be determined and agreed upon as corroborated by AI Ethics
and Resnik.


## How do you Determine a Code of Ethics?
Determining and solidifying a code of ethics requires that any form of research
and study be strictly regulated to prevent unjust or misleading conclusions from
being reached. A conclusion for any research or study should be grounded in
reality and supported by research and evidence, any restriction for a conclusion
to obtain this must be avoided at all costs within a code of ethics, but the
code of ethics must not infrindge on the access to the fair and honest truth.
This will likely lead to lost of bureaucracy surrounding studies as many sets of
eyes should and must review every aspect of a study to ensure that it adheers to
a given and required set of ethics. Should you be considering conducting
research or should you want to validate results and ensure that they are
obtained ethically, here are some existing codes of ethics:
